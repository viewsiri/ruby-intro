# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
# Put the number 5 on screen
#puts 5

# Put the sum of 2 and 5 on screen
#puts 2+5

# Non-numbers
# Put my favorite thing on screen
#puts "tacos"


# True, False
#puts true
#puts false

# Nothing

# Variables
# # Store the number 5 in the computer's memory
# Zebra = 5

# # show the value contained at x on screen
# puts Zebra

# # Replace the value of zebra with 6
# Zebra = Zebra + 6

# # show the value contained at x on screen
# puts Zebra

# # Combine strings and variables

# Store my fav thing in memory
my_favorite_thing = "tacos"

# Store a quantity in memory
number_of_things = 3

# Display the two together
puts "my order is... #{number_of_things} #{my_favorite_thing}"

# # String manipulation
